# Linear-Algebra
Experimental homework notebooks for numerical linear algebra as a part of course studied at Skoltech

Topics include:
1) Matrix decompositions (eigen vector decomposition, LU etc)
2) Iterative methods of low rank approximations (Richardson iteration, Chebyshev iteration, Conjugate gradient method)
3) Pagerank implementation
4) basic recommendation system implementation
5) MPI
6) image deblurring etc
